# MINI-SQL-ENGINE
Mini sql parsing engine using python
CSE4.401: DATA SYSTEMSASSIGNMENT 1DEADLINE: 17:00, 20th January, 2021In this assignment, you are supposed to develop a mini sql engine which will run a subsetof SQL queries using command line interfaceProgramming Languages Allowed : Java, Python and C/C++Dataset:1.csv files for tables.a.If a file is : File1.csv , the table name would be File1b.There will be no tab separation or space separation, so you are not requiredto handle it but you have to make sure to take care of both csv file typecases: the one where values are in double quotes and the one where valuesare without quotes.2.All the elements in files would be only ​INTEGERS3.A file named: metadata.txt (note the extension) would be given to you which willhave the following structure for each table:<begin_table><table_name><attribute1>....<attributeN><end_table>4.Column names are unique among all the tables. So column names ​arenot​ preceded by table names in SQL queries.Type of Queries: ​You’ll be presented with the following set of queries:1.Project​ Columns(could be any number of columns) from one or more tables :a.Select * from table_name;b.Select col1, col2 from table_name;2.Aggregate functions​: Simple aggregate functions on a single column.Sum, average, max, min and count. They will be very trivial given that the datais only integers:Select max(col1) from table_name;
3.Select/project with ​distinct​ from one table: (distinct of a pair of values indicatesthe pair should be distinct)Select distinct col1, col2 from table_name;4.Select with ​WHERE​ from one or more tables :Select col1,col2 from table1,table2 where col1 = 10 AND col2 = 20;a.In the where queries, there would be a maximum of one AND/ORoperator with no NOT operators.b.Relational operators that are to be handled in the assignment, theoperators include "< , >, <=, >=, =".5.Select/Project Columns(could be any number of columns) from table using“​group by​”:  Select col1, COUNT(col2) from table_name group by col1.a.In the group by queries, Sum/Average/Max/Min/Count can be used asaggregate functions.       6.  Select/Project Columns(could be any number of columns) from table inascending/descending order according to a column using “​order by”​:                        Select col1,col2 from table_name order by col1 ASC|DESC.a.At max only one column can be used to sort the rows.b.Query can have multiple tables in it.IMPORTANT:●ERROR HANDLING​: 10% marks will be for error handling.●Fortheabovequeries,pleasenoteallthepermutationsandcombinationsofSQLthatMySQLpermits,speciallywhenitcomestomultipletables.Whatis mentioned above are examples of what the queries could be.●You ​CAN​ use pre built parsers for SQL queriesFormat of Input :Automated evaluation will be done, so include a bash script in your final submission torun the queries. Command to execute a sql query and would be of the form: <RollNumer.sh> “SQL Query”Here, the SQL Query would be a command line argument. Example :“select col(s) from table_name where condition”
Format of Output:<Table1.column1,Table1.column2,...TableN.columnM>Row1Row2.......RowNDeliverables:1.Java/Python/C++ Source Code files.2.Compiled Java/C++ files.3.Bash script as your roll number.4.Keep all of this in a folder Roll Number, zip it and upload.Automated evaluation will be done for this assignment, so strictly stick to the inputformat described in this document and the output format as per the example filesprovided.Copy
